# Excursion

This project is my solution to **Codecademy Excursion Project** (Web Development Fundamentals).

## Objectives

In this project, I had to build a website to advertise a mobile app which helps users record and share their travel experiences. 

The pageâ€™s styling (font sizes, colors, etc.) was outlined in a mock up which I followed.

## Technologies
